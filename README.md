# generate-a-password

## Description
This password generator will create a pseudo-random password of the user's choice of length (between 8 and 128), and based on the user's choices of four parameters: upper case letters included, lower case letters included, numbers included, and/or special characters included.

### Executing the program

Click on the Generate Password button and then answer the prompts above.
The first prompt asks for a number for the length of the password.
The next four prompts ask for an "OK" response if the user would like to include: lowercase letters, uppercase letters, numbers, and/or special characters in their final password or "Cancel" if they do not want that type of character in their final password. After the final  prompt is answered, the password is displayed in the text area.
